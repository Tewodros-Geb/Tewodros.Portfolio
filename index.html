										New Wheels</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/New Wheels.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a data scientist, I worked on a project for New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company that launched an app with end-to-end services for pre-owned vehicle sales. The app provides after-sales service feedback from customers, ensuring the quality of the company's services.
										However, the company was experiencing a decline in sales and negative customer feedback online, leading to a decrease in new customers. The CEO requested a quarterly report with key metrics to assess the health of the business and make necessary decisions.
										My objective was to import a dump file containing various tables from the company's database and use the data to answer the leadership's questions. I analyzed the data and created a quarterly business report for the CEO, presenting key metrics and insights to support strategic decisions.
										Through my work on this project, I demonstrated my skills in data analysis, report writing, and business strategy</p>

To help the company's director make data-driven decisions on the subscription model, I designed an interactive dashboard.
